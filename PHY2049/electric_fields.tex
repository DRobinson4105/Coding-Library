\section*{Electric Field Lines}
Electric field lines are continuous lines which have the same direction as the electric field

\begin{itemize}
    \item Electric field lines are continuous curves tangent to the electric field vectors
    \item Closely spaced field lines indicate a greater field strength
    \item Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges
    \item Electric field lines never cross
\end{itemize}

\[\vec{E}(\vec{r})=\int \frac{kdq}{r^2}\hat{r}\]
where $dq$ is a small element of charge at each point in a electric field produced by a continuous
distribution of charge and $r$ is the distance from that small point in the electric field to the
point

\subsection*{Linear Charge Density}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The linear charge density of an object of length $L$ and charge $Q$ is defined as
    $\lambda=\frac{Q}{L}$
    \item Linear charge density, which has units of $C/m$, is the amount of charge per meter of
    length
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Surface Charge Density}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The surface charge density of a two-dimensional distribution of charge across a surface
    of area $A$ is defined as $\eta = \frac{Q}{A}$
    \item Surface charge density, which has units of $C/m^2$, is the amount of charge per square
    meter
\end{itemize}

\section*{Electric Dipoles}
Dipole moment $p=q\times d$ where $d$ is a vector directed from negative charge to the positive one
and $q$ is the magnitude of charge

When the dipole moment $\vec{p}$ is at an angle $\theta$ to the field, causing the dipole to
experience a torque, $\tau = r\times F$. Each charge experiences force $F=qE$. The net force on the
dipole is zero because the forces are of opposite directions so dipole will not move as a whole in
electric field.
\[|\tau | = pE\sin (\theta)\] where $\theta$ is the angle between the dipole moment and the
electric field
