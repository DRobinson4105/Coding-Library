\section*{Types of Proofs}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Direct Argument - Assume the premise is true and logically deduce the conclusion with a sequence of logical steps
    \item Construction - Prove something exists by showing how to make
    \item Contradiction - Prove something is true by showing it can't be false
    \item Weak Induction - Show that a statement is true for the case of $0$ and if it's true for the case of $i$, then it's true for the case of $i+1$
    \item Strong Induction - Show that a statement is true for the case of $0$ and if it's true for all cases $<i$, then it's true for the case of $i$
\end{enumerate}
