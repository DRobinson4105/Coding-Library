\subsection*{Pigeonhole Principle}

If $n$ items are put into $m$ containers with $n>m$, at least one container contains more than one item.

\section*{Pumping Lemma}

If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a number $p$, the pumping length, so that if $s$ is a string in $A$ with length of at least $p$, then $s=xyz$, so that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $xy^i z$ is a string in $A$ for all $i\geq 0$, where $y^i$ is $y$ concatenated to itself $i$ times
    \item $|y| > 0$
    \item $|xy| \leq p$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Proof}

Let $M=(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a DFA recognizing language $A$, and let $p=|Q|$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider $s\in A$ so that $|s|=n$, with $n\geq p$.
    \item Show that $s=xyz$ so that $xy^i z$ is a string in $A$ for all $i\geq 0$, with $|y|>0$ and $|xy|\leq p$.
\end{itemize}

Let $s=s_1 s_2\cdots s_n$ be a string accepted by $M$, with $n\geq p$.
\vspace{1em}

Let $r_1 r_2 \cdots r_{n+1}$ be the sequence of states that $M$ enters while computing $S$. Observe that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The state sequence has length $n+1$, which is at least $p+1$
    \item Within the first $p+1$ states in the sequence, two different points in the sequence have to be the same state, by the pigeonhole principle
    \item Call the first one $r_j$ and the second one $r_k$
\end{itemize}

Now let $x=s_1\cdots s_{j-1}$, $y=s_j\cdots s_{k-1}$, and $z=s_k\cdots s_n$.
\vspace{1em}

Observe that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x$ takes $M$ from $r_1$ to $r_j$
    \item $y$ takes $M$ from $r_j$ to $r_k$
    \item $z$ takes $M$ from $r_k$ to $r_{n+1}$
    \item Therefore, $M$ must accept $xy^i z$ for all $i\geq 0$
\end{itemize}

Observe that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since $j\neq k, |y|>0$
\end{itemize}

Finally, observe that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since $k\leq p+1, |xy|\leq p$
\end{itemize}

We have shown that all three conditions of the pumping lemma hold.
